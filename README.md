# PygmalionPython
A python chat bot that uses the kobaldAI API. Replace the ENDPOINT url in the main.py file with your locally run url or the one generated from this [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZvYq4GmjfsyIkcTQcrBhSFXs8vQLLMAS)

```Python
# Set the endpoint URL
endpoint = "https://aaron-example-test-containers.trycloudflare.com" 
```

# Characters
You can create characters [here](https://oobabooga.github.io/character-creator.html) 
Take the output and put it in notepad or notepadd++ and save as a .json file in the Characters folder.

For creating characters I recommend asking chat gpt to make you characters in "this format" then paste the json file.
